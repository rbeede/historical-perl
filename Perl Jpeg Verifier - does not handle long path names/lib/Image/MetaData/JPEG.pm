# Constructor for a JPEG file structure object, accepting #
# a "JPEG stream". It parses the file stream and stores   #
# its sections internally. An optional parameter can ex-  #
# clude parsing and even storing for some segments. The   #
# stream can be specified in two ways:                    #
# - [a scalar] interpreted as a file name to be opened;   #
# - [a scalar reference] interpreted as a pointer to an   #
#   in-memory buffer containing a JPEG stream;            #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# There is now a second argument, $regex. This string is  #
# matched against segment names, and only those segments  #
# with a positive match are parsed. This allows for some  #
# speed-up if you just need partial information. For      #
# instance, if you just want to manipulate the comments,  #
# you could use $regex equal to 'COM'. If $regex is unde- #
# fined, all segments are matched.                        #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# There is now a third optional argument, $options. If it #
# matches the string 'FASTREADONLY', only those segments  #
# matching $regex are actually stored; also, everything   #
# which is found after a Start Of Scan is completely      #
# neglected. This allows for very large speed-ups, but,   #
# obviously, you cannot rebuild the file afterwards, so   #
# this is only for getting information fast (e.g., when   #
# doing a directory scan).                                #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# If an unrecoverable error occurs during the execution   #
# of the constructor, the undefined value is returned     #
# instead of the object reference, and a meaningful error #
# message is set up (read it with Error()).               #

# The object is then inserted into the "segments" hash,   #
# with a code-related key. Raw (compressed) image data    #
# are stored in "fake" segments, just for simplicity.     #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# There is now an argument, set equal to the second argu- #
# ment of the constructor. If it is defined, only match-  #
# ing segments are parsed. Also, if read_only is set,     #

# 2 bytes  segment marker (the first byte is always 0xff) #
# 2 bytes  segment_length (it doesn't include the marker) #
#               .... data (segment_length - 2 bytes)      #
#=========================================================#
# The segment length (2 bytes) has a "Motorola" (big end- #
# ian) endianness (byte alignement), that is it starts    #
# with the most significant digit. Note that the segment  #
# length marker counts its own length (i.e., after it     #
# there are only segment_length-2 bytes).                 #
#=========================================================#
# Some segments do not have data after them (not even the #
# length field, they are pure markers): SOI, EOI and the  #
# RST? restart segments. Scans (started by a SOS segment) #
# are followed by compressed data, with possibly inter-   #
# leaved RST segments: raw data must be searched with a   #
# dedicated routine because they are not envelopped.      #

# by any number of fill bytes (padding of the previous    #
# segment, I suppose), set to 0xff. Most markers start    #
# marker segments containing a related group of parame-   #
