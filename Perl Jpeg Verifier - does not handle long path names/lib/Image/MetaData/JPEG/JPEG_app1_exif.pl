# This method accepts two arguments ($what and $type) and #
# returns the content of the Exif APP1 segment packed in  #
# various forms. All Exif records are natively identified #
# by numeric tags (keys), which can be "translated" into  #
# a human-readable form by using the Exif standard docs;  #
# only a few fields in the Exif APP1 preamble (they are   #
# not Exif records) are always identified by this module  #
# by means of textual tags. The $type argument selects    #
# the output format for the record keys (tags):           #
#  - NUMERIC: record tags are native numeric keys         #
#  - TEXTUAL: record tags are human-readable (default)    #
# Of course, record values are never translated. If a     #
# numeric Exif tag is not known, a custom textual key is  #
# created with "Unknown_tag_" followed by the numerical   #
# value (this solves problems with non-standard tags).    #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# Error conditions (invalid $what's and $type's) manifest #
# themselves through an undefined return value. So, undef #
# should not be used for other cases: use empty hashes or #
# a reference to an empty string for the thumbnail.       #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# The subset of Exif tags returned by this method is      #
# determined by the value of $what. If $what is set equal #
# to '*_DATA', this method returns a reference to a flat  #
# hash, corresponding to one or more IFD (sub)dirs:       #
#  - ROOT_DATA      APP1(TIFF header records and similar) #
#  - IFD0_DATA      APP1@IFD0   (primary image TIFF tags) #
#  - SUBIFD_DATA    APP1@IFD0@SubIFD (Exif private tags)  #
#  - GPS_DATA       APP1@IFD0@GPS    (GPS data in IFD0)   #
#  - INTEROP_DATA   APP1@IFD0@SubIFD@Interop(erability)   #  
#  - IFD1_DATA      APP1@IFD1   (thumbnail TIFF tags)     #
#  - IMAGE_DATA     a merge of IFD0_DATA and SUBIFD_DATA  #
#  - THUMB_DATA     an alias for IFD1_DATA                #
# Setting $what equal to 'ALL' returns a data dump very   #
# close to the Exif APP1 segment structure; the returned  #
# value is a reference to a hash of hashes: each element  #
# of the root-level hash is a pair ($name, $hashref),     #
# where $hashref points to a second-level hash containing #
# a copy of all Exif records present in the $name IFD     #
# (sub)directory. The root-level hash includes a special  #
# root directory (named 'APP1') containing some non Exif  #
# parameters. Last, setting $what to 'THUMBNAIL' returns  #
# a reference to a copy of the actual Exif thumbnail      #
# image (not returned by 'THUMB_DATA'), if present, or a  #
# reference to an empty string, if not present.           #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# Note that the Exif record values' format is not checked #
# to be valid according to the Exif standard. This is, in #
# some sense, consistent with the fact that also "unknown"#
# tags are included in the output.                        #

# This method is the entry point for setting Exif data in #
# the current APP1 segment. The mandatory arguments are:  #
# $data (hash reference, with new records to be written), #
# $what (a scalar, selecting the concerned portion of the #
# Exif APP1 segment) and $action (a scalar specifying the #
# requested action). Valid values are:                    #
#   $action --> ADD | REPLACE                             #
#   $what --> IFD0_DATA, IFD1_DATA, INTEROP_DATA,         #
#             GPS_DATA, SUBIFD_DATA (see get_Exif_data)   #
#             THUMB_DATA (an alias for IFD1_DATA)         #
#             IMAGE_DATA (IFD0_DATA or SUBIFD_DATA)       #
#             ROOT_DATA  (only 'Endianness' can be set)   #
#          .- THUMBNAIL  (including automatic fields)     #
#          \____.--> $data is a scalar reference here ... #
# The behaviour of $action is similar to that for IPTC    #
# data. Note that Exif records are non-repeatable in      #
# nature, so there is no need for an 'UPDATE' action in   #
# addition to 'ADD' (they would both overwrite an old re- #
# cord with the same tag as a new record); $action equal  #
# to 'REPLACE', on the other hand, clears the appropriate #
# record list(s) before the insertions. Records are       #
# rewritten in increasing (numerical) tag order.          #
# The elements of $data which can be converted to valid   #
# records are inserted in the appropriate (sub)IFD, the   #
# others are returned. The return value is always a hash  #
# reference; in general it contains rejected records. If  #
# an error occurs in a very early stage of the setter,    #
# this reference contains a single entry with key='ERROR' #
# and value set to some meaningful error message. So, a   #
# reference to an empty hash means that everything was OK.#
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# $what equal to 'THUMBNAIL' is meant to replace the IFD1 #
# thumbnail. $data should be a reference to a scalar      #
# containing the new thumbnail; if it points to an emtpy  #
# string, the thumbnail is erased. Corresponding fields   #
# follow the thumbnail (all this is dealt with by a       #
# special private method). $data undefined DOES NOT erase #
# the thumbnail, it is an error (too dangerous).          #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# When $what is 'IMAGE_DATA', try to insert first into    #
# SubIFD, then, into IFD0. This favours SubIFD standard   #
# tags in front of IFD company-related non-standard tags. #
# For security reasons however, these non-standard tags   #
# should be labelled as invalid: this would prevent them  #
# from being set but not from being recognised if present.#
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# Remeber that, even for $action eq REPLACE, we cannot    #
# delete all the records. We must preserve $REFERENCE     #
# records, otherwise the corresponding directories would  #
# be forgotten; we don't want that, for instance, SubIFD  #
# is deleted when the records of IFD0 are REPLACEd.       #
# ------------------------------------------------------- #
# First, some basic argument checking is performed: the   #
# segment must be of the appropriate type, $data must be  #
# a hash reference, $action and $what must be valid.      #
# Then, the appropriate record (sub)directory is created  #
# (this can trigger the creation of other directories),   #
# if it is not present. Then records are screened and     #
# set. Mandatory data are added, if not present, at the   #
# end of the process (see Tables.pm for this). Note that  #
# there are some record intercorrelations still neglected.#

# This method takes a hash reference [$data] and an IFD   #
# path specification [$path] (like 'APP1@IFD0@GPS'). It   #
# then tries to convert the elements of $data into valid  #
# records according to the specific syntactical rules of  #
# the corresponding IFD. It returns a list of two hash    #
# references: the first list contains the key-recordref   #
# pairs for successful conversions, the other one the     #
# key-value(ref) pairs for unsuccessful ones.             #
#---------------------------------------------------------#
# Records' tags can be give textually or numerically.     #
# First, the tags are checked for validity and converted  #
# to numeric form (records with undefined values are      #
# immediately rejected). Then, the specifications for     #
# each tag are read from a helper table and values are    #
# matched against a regular expression (or a surrogate,   #
# see %special_screen_rules). Then a Record object is     #
# forged and evaluated to see if it is valid and it       #
# corresponds to the user will.                           #
#---------------------------------------------------------#
# New feature: if the record value is a code reference    #
# instead of an array reference, the corresponding code   #
# is executed (passing the segment reference through) and #
# the result is stored. This is necessary for mandatory   #
# records which need to know the current segment.         #
#---------------------------------------------------------#
# New feature. The syntax hash can have a fifth field,    #
# acting as a filter. Unless it matches the optional      #
# $fregex argument, the record is rejected. This allows   #
# us to exclude some tags from general usage. If $fregex  #
# is undefined, all tags with a filter are rejected.      #
